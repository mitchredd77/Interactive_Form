An interactive form with field validation. The form begins with focusing on the "Name"
field for the user to get started. The name input box will display a warning if the user
attempts to move forward with a blank name. Next is the Job Role Section, the other job input box
will not appear until "Other" is chosen in the dropdown box. The T-Shirt Section
will display only the colors available for the chosen design. 

A warning will be displayed if the name field is blank. A warning will be displayed if the email address is blank and a different warning will be displayed if it's not formatted correctly. The credit card number must be 13 - 16 numbers. The zip code must be 5 numbers and the cvv field must be 3 numbers. 

The total cost accumulates as activities are chosen and activities with conflicting times will be disabled. If the payment method is PayPal or Bitcoin the credit card fields are removed.
